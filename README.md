# Real-time Stream Simulation & Event Trigger
Simulates a real-time stream, performing detection on every third frame and triggering an alert if three or more people appear on the screen (three's a crowd!). The alerts are logged in a JSON file with timestamps, and are also plotted with a timeline of alert occurences. The alerts are overlayed and the output visuals are exported.
## Pre-requisites:- Rename the short video to 'input_video.mp4' in the current directory, and create two folders: 'output_video' and 'output_images' in the directory you run your code from
raw file - Real-time_Stream_Simulation_and_Event_Trigger.py
